minilog_libertad
================

Simple netlist verilog reader and .LIB format reader.

This source code provides two basic libraries:
- MINILOG is a simple verilog netlist parser
- LIBERTAD is a simple .LIB parser


Requirements:
---------------
You must have Bison, Flex and Doxygen installed.


Documentation:
--------------
The documentation is autogenerated using Doxygen, type 
```bash
make Doc
```

After running the previous commands, the docs can be found in
- LIBERTAD/DOC
- MINILOG/DOC


Compilation:
------------
To compile the libraries and sample applications, type
```bash
make All
```

This will produce 3 sample executable files demo-ing the APIs.
- LIBERTAD/EXAMPLES/libreader.exe
- MINILOG/EXAMPLES/vlogreader.exe
- EXAMPLES/netlib.exe

Three libraries will be produced too:
- UTILS/LIB/*/libutil.a
- LIBERTAD/LIB/*/liblibertad.a
- MINILOG/LIB/*/libminilog.a
